# Official One Pace Subtitle Integration Guide

Your OnePaceStremio addon now supports **official One Pace subtitles** directly from the [One Pace Subtitle Repository](https://github.com/one-pace/one-pace-public-subtitles/tree/main/main/Release/Final%20Subs)! This provides the most accurate and synchronized subtitles available, with OpenSubtitles as a fallback.

## What's New

The addon now includes these new configuration options:

1. **Preferred Subtitle Languages**
   - English only
   - English + Spanish
   - English + French
   - English + Portuguese
   - English + German

## How It Works

### Priority System for Each Episode:
1. **🎌 Official One Pace Subtitles** (Highest Priority)
   - Direct from the official One Pace subtitle repository
   - Perfect synchronization with One Pace episodes
   - Available in multiple languages when provided by the team

2. **🔤 Embedded Subtitles** (Medium Priority)
   - Original subtitles from the video file (if working)
   - Built into the video stream

3. **👥 Community Subtitles** (Fallback)
   - OpenSubtitles database as backup
   - Generic One Piece subtitles adapted for One Pace

### Official Subtitle Search Strategy:
The addon searches the [One Pace repository](https://github.com/one-pace/one-pace-public-subtitles/tree/main/main/Release/Final%20Subs) using:
- **Episode ID mapping**: RO_1, SY_3, WA_5, etc.
- **Arc-based folders**: Romance Dawn, Syrup Village, Water 7, etc.
- **Multiple naming conventions**: Different filename patterns
- **Language detection**: Automatic language identification from filenames
- **Format support**: SRT, VTT, and ASS subtitle formats

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Update Your Addon
The integration is already implemented in your addon files:
- `opensubtitles-integration.js` - Core subtitle fetching logic
- `addon.js` - Updated to integrate external subtitles
- `manifest.json` - New configuration options

### 2. Configure Subtitle Preferences
When installing the addon in Stremio:
1. Select your preferred subtitle languages

3. Install the addon

### 3. Test the Integration
The integration has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Repository connection successful

Official subtitles will appear automatically when available in the [repository](https://github.com/one-pace/one-pace-public-subtitles/tree/main/main/Release/Final%20Subs).
