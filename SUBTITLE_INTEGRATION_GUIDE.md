# Official One Pace Subtitle Integration Guide

Your OnePaceStremio addon now supports **official One Pace subtitles** directly from the [One Pace Subtitle Repository](https://github.com/one-pace/one-pace-public-subtitles/tree/main/main/Release/Final%20Subs)! This provides the most accurate and synchronized subtitles available, with OpenSubtitles as a fallback.

### Official Subtitle Search Strategy:

- **Episode ID mapping**: RO_1, SY_3, WA_5, etc.
- **Arc-based folders**: Romance Dawn, Syrup Village, Water 7, etc.
- **Multiple naming conventions**: Different filename patterns
- **Language detection**: Automatic language identification from filenames
- **Format support**: SRT, VTT, and ASS subtitle formats

## Installation & Setup

### 2. Configure Subtitle Preferences
When installing the addon in Stremio:
